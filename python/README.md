# Python Part

This part there're three files, the `deserialize.py` shows how python serialization module  `pickle` works. The `pickle_RCE.py` shows the Remote Code Execution attack achieved by utilizing the deserialization attack towards `pickle`. The `pickle_reverseshell.py` shows the reverse shell attack.

If you want to test them, run `python [file name]` directly.
